# New York Public Radio Design System

## About

The NYPR Product Design team aims to maintain a consistent style across all NYPR products. To facilitate this, we have created the following style guide documenting a system of reusable components. Our goal is to achieve a faster and smarter process for product design and development.

Our design system is based on the principles of [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design). The idea behind this methodology is that small elements of our products (atoms) can be designed and then combined into larger modules (molecules) which can then be combined into organisms. These elements can then be stitched together to form templates and pages.

This design system is a living document and will be updated regularly.
