            <h2>Guidelines</h2>
            <p>We maintain a custom icon set with a consistent style that is simple, airy, and legible, serving to compliment a visual aesthetic without detracting from usability. We heavily user-test our icons to ensure that they are interpreted correctly and perceived as consistent with the brand. As our user demographic is often not tech-savvy, any icons that are not easily recognized must also be accompanied with a text label. All icons used must be inline with WNYCâ€™s icon style in terms of consistent line thickness and rounding of edges, and they must be legible on small mobile screens.</p>
            <p>If you want to use an icon, first check that one does not currently exist on our site for the concept youâ€™re illustrating. If not, you can reach out to the digital team to have them create one. Or you can find icons on The Nounproject or Fontawesome. All icons must be in SVG format.</p>
